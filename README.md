# Zig + Raylib + Lua

(my three favorite things atm!)

This is a barebones starter template for a game programming project using [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), and [Lua](https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua).

Some Lua features, such as JIT compilation, still don't work.
However, the project can compile and is running on an M1 Mac with Zig version `0.14.0-dev.2802+257054a14`.

There might be more work needed to make this project compile for Windows and Linux
